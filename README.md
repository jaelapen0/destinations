# Overview
## Destinations is a site that presents you with a list of beautiful cities, showcasing, select images pulled using Flickr's API and information through Wiki's API.
There is a fun PhotoBooth, using the BodyPix library. You can take a photo with your webcam, then it cuts out the background, 
and you select an image from the Flickr Feed, to set as the background, with an option to download.
